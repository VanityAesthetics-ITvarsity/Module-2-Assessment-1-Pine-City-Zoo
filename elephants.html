                    <h3>ELEPHANTS</h3>
                    <p>Elephants, the largest land animals, encompass three recognized species:
                        the African bush elephant, the African forest elephant, and the Asian elephant. 
                        They stand as the sole survivors of the Elephantidae family and Proboscidea order, with mammoths and mastodons as their extinct kin.
                        Notable features include their trunk for feeding and grasping, tusks serving both as weapons and tools, large ear flaps aiding in thermoregulation and communication, sturdy legs, and sensitive grey skin. 
                        African elephants exhibit larger ears and concave backs, while Asian elephants possess smaller ears and convex or level backs.</p>
                    <p>Elephants inhabit diverse habitats across sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia, including savannahs, forests, deserts, and marshes, preferring areas near water sources. 
                        As herbivores, they play a crucial role as keystone species in their ecosystems. They exhibit a fission-fusion social structure, with multiple family groups gathering for social interaction. 
                        Female elephants, or cows, typically form family groups led by the oldest female, known as the matriarch, which can include one female with her calves or several related females with offspring.</p>
                    <p>Male elephants, or bulls, typically leave their family groups upon reaching puberty, living solitarily or with other males. 
                        They mainly interact with family groups during mating pursuits, undergoing periods of heightened testosterone and aggression known as musth to assert dominance and enhance reproductive success. 
                        Calves receive significant attention within family groups and rely on maternal care for up to three years. 
                        Elephants boast lifespans of up to 70 years in the wild and communicate through touch, sight, smell, and sound, utilizing infrasound and seismic signals for long-distance communication. 
                        Their intelligence is often likened to that of primates and cetaceans, demonstrating self-awareness and potentially displaying concern for dying or deceased members of their species.</p>
                    <p>African bush elephants and Asian elephants are endangered, while African forest elephants are critically endangered according to the IUCN. 
                        Their main threat is the ivory trade, leading to poaching for tusks. Habitat destruction and conflicts with humans also endanger wild populations. 
                        In Asia, elephants are used as working animals, and historically in warfare. Presently, they face controversy in zoos and circuses for entertainment. 
                        Elephants hold an iconic status in human culture, appearing prominently in art, folklore, religion, literature, and popular media.</p>
                    <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                    <p>You will find the elephants at pen E22, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>
