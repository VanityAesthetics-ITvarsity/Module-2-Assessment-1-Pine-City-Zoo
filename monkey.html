                    <h3>MONKEY</h3>
                    <p>"Monkey" is a general term that often refers to mammals within the infraorder Simiiformes, also known as simians. 
                        Traditionally, all members of the group excluding apes were considered monkeys, creating a paraphyletic grouping. 
                        However, in a broader sense based on cladistics, apes (Hominoidea) are also included, making "monkeys" and "simians" synonymous in scope.</p>
                    <p>Monkey species exhibit diverse lifestyles, with many being arboreal (tree-dwelling), while others, like baboons, primarily inhabit the ground. 
                        Most monkeys are active during the day (diurnal). 
                        They are generally recognized for their intelligence, particularly Old World monkeys.</p>
                    <p>Monkeys, along with apes, are characterized by having only two pectoral nipples, a pendulous penis, and an absence of sensory whiskers, features that differentiate them from other primates.</p>
                    <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                    <p>You will find the monkeys at pen E11, right next to the koalas.</p>
