                    <h3>LION</h3>
                    <p>The lion, Panthera leo, is a large cat found in Africa and India, characterized by its muscular build, short rounded head, round ears, and tufted tail. 
                        It displays sexual dimorphism, with males being larger and possessing a mane. 
                        Lions are social animals, forming prides comprised of adult males, related females, and cubs. 
                        Female lions often hunt together, primarily targeting large ungulates. 
                        As apex and keystone predators, lions play a crucial role in their ecosystems. 
                        While they may scavenge and sporadically hunt humans, they typically do not actively seek out human prey.</p>
                    <p>The lion occupies grasslands, savannahs, and shrublands, primarily displaying diurnal behavior. 
                        However, it can adapt to being active at night and twilight when threatened. 
                        Historically ranging from Southeast Europe to India during the Neolithic period, the lion's population has significantly declined, now existing in fragmented populations in sub-Saharan Africa and western India. 
                        Since 1996, it has been classified as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List, with African populations decreasing by approximately 43% since the early 1990s. 
                        Lion populations rely heavily on designated protected areas, with habitat loss and human conflicts posing significant threats to their survival.</p>
                    <p>The lion is one of the most iconic symbols in human culture, depicted in various forms such as sculptures, paintings, national flags, literature, and films. 
                        Since the time of the Roman Empire, lions have been kept in menageries and have been a popular attraction in zoological gardens since the late 18th century. 
                        Ancient Egypt notably featured cultural depictions of lions, and these representations have appeared in almost all ancient and medieval cultures within the lion's historic and current range.</p>
                    <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                    <p>You will find the lions at pen E27.</p>
