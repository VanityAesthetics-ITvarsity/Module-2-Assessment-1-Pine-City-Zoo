                    <h3>TIGER</h3>
                    <p>The tiger, Panthera tigris, is the largest living cat species native to Asia, belonging to the genus Panthera. 
                        It possesses a robust, muscular body with a large head, powerful paws, a long tail, and recognizable black stripes on orange fur. 
                        Scientifically described in 1758, it is traditionally classified into eight subspecies, although some recognize only two: mainland Asian tigers and island tigers of the Sunda Islands.</p>
                    <p>The tiger is predominantly found in forests across its range, from temperate regions in the Russian Far East to tropical forests in the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia. As an apex predator, it preys mainly on ungulates like deer and wild boar, often using ambush tactics. 
                        Tigers are solitary animals, maintaining and defending their own home ranges from individuals of the same sex. 
                        A male tiger's territory often overlaps with those of multiple females, with whom he mates. 
                        Female tigers typically give birth to two or three cubs, which stay with their mother for about two years before becoming independent and establishing their own territories.</p>
                    <p>Since the early 20th century, tiger populations have seen a significant decline, losing at least 93% of their historic range and becoming locally extinct in several regions, including West and Central Asia, large parts of China, and the islands of Java and Bali. 
                        Today, tiger habitats are severely fragmented. The species is listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List, with its range decreasing by 53% to 68% since the late 1990s. 
                        Major threats include habitat destruction and fragmentation from deforestation, poaching for fur, and illegal trade of tiger body parts for medicinal purposes. 
                        Tigers also face human-wildlife conflict due to habitat encroachment in densely populated areas, and occasionally attack or prey on people.</p>
                    <p>Tigers are globally renowned charismatic megafauna, captivating human fascination for centuries. 
                        They've been kept in captivity since ancient times, often trained for circus performances and entertainment shows, and are popular in the exotic pet trade. 
                        Tigers hold significant cultural significance, featuring prominently in the mythology and folklore of cultures across their historic range and continuing to be celebrated in cultures worldwide.</p>
                    <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                    <p>You will find the tigers at pen E28.</p>
