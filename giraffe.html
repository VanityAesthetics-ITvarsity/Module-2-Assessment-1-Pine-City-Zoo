                    <h3>GIRAFFE</h3>
                    <p>The giraffe, a large African mammal of the genus Giraffa, stands as the tallest terrestrial animal and the largest ruminant globally. 
                        Historically classified as one species with nine subspecies, recent studies suggest potentially up to eight extant species based on mitochondrial, nuclear DNA, and morphological analysis. 
                        Additionally, the fossil record reveals seven extinct Giraffa species.</p>
                    <p>The giraffe's notable features include its long neck and legs, horn-like ossicones, and spotted coat patterns. 
                        Belonging to the Giraffidae family, it shares this classification with its closest living relative, the okapi. 
                        Giraffes are found across a wide range, from Chad to South Africa and from Niger to Somalia, typically inhabiting savannahs and woodlands. 
                        They feed primarily on leaves, fruits, and flowers of woody plants, especially acacia species, browsing at heights inaccessible to many other herbivores.</p>
                    <p>Giraffes face predation from lions, leopards, spotted hyenas, and African wild dogs. 
                        They form herds consisting of related females and their offspring or bachelor groups of unrelated adult males, occasionally gathering in large gatherings. 
                        Male giraffes establish social hierarchies through "necking," combat using their necks as weapons. 
                        Dominant males gain mating privileges with females, who are solely responsible for raising the young.</p>
                    <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                    <p>You will find the giraffes at pen E24, right next to the gemsbok.</p>
