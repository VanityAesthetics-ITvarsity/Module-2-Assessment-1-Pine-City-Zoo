                    <h3>WARTHOG</h3>
                    <p>Phacochoerus is a genus within the Suidae family, commonly referred to as warthogs. 
                        These pigs inhabit open and semi-open habitats, including arid regions, across sub-Saharan Africa. 
                        Previously, both species were classified under the scientific name Phacochoerus aethiopicus, but now, only the desert warthog retains this name, while the more well-known and widespread species is the common warthog, scientifically known as Phacochoerus africanus.</p>
                    <p>Warthogs, characterized by their bristly hairs, appear largely naked from a distance, with noticeable crests along their backs and tufts on their cheeks and tails. 
                        Their facial wattles, particularly distinct in males, give them their English name. 
                        They possess distinctive tusks, with males' tusks reaching lengths of 10 to 25 inches (25 to 64 centimeters), while females have smaller tusks. 
                        Primarily herbivorous, warthogs occasionally consume small animals. 
                        Despite being fairly common and widespread, both species are considered of Least Concern by the IUCN. 
                        However, the nominate subspecies of the desert warthog, known as the Cape warthog, became extinct around 1865.</p>
                    <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                    <p>You will find the warthogs at pen E9.</p>
