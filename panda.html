                    <h3>PANDA</h3>
                    <p>The giant panda, also known as the panda bear, is a bear species native to China, known for its distinctive black-and-white fur and round body. 
                        It is larger than the red panda, another nearby species. 
                        Adult giant pandas typically weigh between 100 to 115 kg (220 to 254 lb) and measure 1.2 to 1.9 m (3 ft 11 in to 6 ft 3 in) in length, with males being larger. 
                        Their fur is white with black patches around the eyes, ears, legs, and shoulders. 
                        They possess a thumb-like structure on their forepaws, aiding in bamboo consumption. 
                        Giant pandas have evolved specialized molars and skull features to accommodate their bamboo-based diet.</p>
                    <p>The giant panda is restricted to six mountain ranges within a few provinces, inhabiting elevations of up to 3,000 m (9,800 ft). 
                        Despite being classified as a member of the Carnivora order, it is primarily herbivorous, feeding almost exclusively on bamboo shoots. 
                        These shoots are crucial as they are rich in starch and protein. 
                        Giant pandas are solitary creatures, congregating only for mating purposes. 
                        Female pandas rear their cubs for an average of 18 to 24 months. Sub-adult pandas may face threats from predators like leopards. 
                        Scent marking plays a vital role in their communication, and they have been observed to live up to 38 years.</p>
                    <p>Due to farming, deforestation, and development, the giant panda has lost much of its lowland habitat and is now considered a vulnerable species dependent on conservation efforts. 
                        A 2007 report identified 239 pandas in captivity within China and 27 outside the country. 
                        Despite past declines, recent reports indicate a rise in the wild panda population, reaching 1,864 individuals by March 2015. 
                        This progress led to the reclassification of the giant panda from "endangered" to "vulnerable" on the IUCN Red List in 2016, reflecting ongoing conservation efforts. 
                        In July 2021, Chinese authorities also reclassified the giant panda as vulnerable. 
                        The giant panda holds significant cultural importance in China, serving as a national symbol, appearing on coins and as a mascot for events like the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing.</p>
                    <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                    <p>You will find the pandas at pen E15, next to the insect house.</p>
