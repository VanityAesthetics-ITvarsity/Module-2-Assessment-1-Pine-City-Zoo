                    <h3>GORILLA</h3>
                    <p>Gorillas, primarily herbivorous, are large ground-dwelling great apes found in the tropical forests of equatorial Africa. 
                        They are divided into two species: the eastern gorilla and the western gorilla, with four or five subspecies. 
                        Gorillas share a high genetic similarity with humans, ranging from 95 to 99%, making them our closest living relatives after chimpanzees and bonobos.</p>
                    <p>Gorillas, the largest living primates, typically stand between 1.25 and 1.8 meters tall, weigh between 100 and 270 kilograms, and have arm spans of up to 2.6 meters, varying by species and sex. 
                        They often reside in troops led by a silverback. The eastern gorilla differs from the western gorilla with darker fur and minor morphological distinctions. 
                        In the wild, gorillas typically live 35 to 40 years.</p>
                    <p>Gorillas inhabit tropical or subtropical forests in Sub-Saharan Africa, covering a diverse range of elevations. 
                        Mountain gorillas reside in the Albertine Rift montane cloud forests of the Virunga Volcanoes, ranging from 2,200 to 4,300 meters (7,200 to 14,100 feet) above sea level. 
                        Lowland gorillas inhabit dense forests, swamps, and marshes, ranging from sea level up to higher elevations. 
                        Western lowland gorillas are found in Central West African countries, while eastern lowland gorillas live near the border of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda.</p>
                    <p>Both western and eastern gorilla species face critical endangerment, with estimated populations of around 316,000 for western gorillas and 5,000 for eastern gorillas. 
                        All subspecies are classified as critically endangered except for the mountain gorilla, which is considered endangered. 
                        Threats to their survival include poaching, habitat destruction, and disease. 
                        Despite these challenges, conservation efforts have shown success in certain regions where gorillas reside.</p>
                    <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                    <p>You will find the gorillas at pen E21, next to the elephants.</p>
