                    <h3>KOALA</h3>
                    <p>The koala, or Phascolarctos cinereus, is an arboreal herbivorous marsupial native to Australia, often referred to as the koala bear. 
                        It is the sole living member of the family Phascolarctidae, closely related to wombats. 
                        Found in coastal areas of eastern and southern Australia, including Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia, it is characterized by a stout, tailless body, large head with round, fluffy ears, and a distinctive dark nose. 
                        Koalas measure 60-85 cm (24-33 in) in length and weigh 4-15 kg (9-33 lb), with fur color ranging from silver grey to chocolate brown. 
                        Northern koalas are typically smaller and lighter than their southern counterparts, potentially indicating separate subspecies, although this is debated.</p>
                    <p>Koalas primarily inhabit open Eucalyptus woodlands, relying on eucalypt leaves as their main diet, which are low in nutrition and contain toxins deterring other mammals. 
                        They are largely sedentary, sleeping up to twenty hours a day, and are asocial, forming bonds only with mothers and dependent offspring. 
                        Adult males communicate with loud bellows to intimidate rivals and attract mates, marking their presence with scent gland secretions. 
                        As marsupials, koalas give birth to underdeveloped young that stay in their mothers' pouches for six to seven months, known as joeys, and are weaned around one year old. 
                        While having few natural predators, koalas are threatened by pathogens like Chlamydiaceae bacteria and koala retrovirus.</p>
                    <p>Koalas, recognized worldwide as iconic symbols of Australia alongside kangaroos and emus, have a rich cultural and historical significance. 
                        Indigenous Australians hunted them and depicted them in myths and cave art for thousands of years. 
                        European encounters with koalas began in the late 18th century, with the first recorded encounter in 1798 and the first published image in 1810. 
                        Scientific descriptions followed, with botanist Robert Brown providing the first detailed account in 1814. 
                        Koalas gained further attention in the 19th century through illustrations and scientific studies by British scientists. 
                        Despite their cultural importance, koalas face threats to their existence, including habitat destruction from agriculture, urbanization, droughts, and bushfires exacerbated by climate change. 
                        They are listed as vulnerable by the IUCN and were officially declared endangered in several Australian regions in February 2022.</p>
                    <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                    <p>You will find the koalas at pen E10, by the trees.</p>
