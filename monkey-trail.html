                    <h3>MONKEY TRAIL</h3>
                    <p>Take an educational stroll on the monkey trail and encounter the friendliest and cutest animals to walk planet earth.
                        The monkey's habitat is safeguarded by a transparent screen, ensuring both conservation and safety.
                        Dispite this protective barrier, their monkey's amiable and inquisitive demeanor remains unmistakably visible, inviting viewers
                        to observe them in their natural surroundings.</p>
                      
                      <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND IT?</strong></p>
                      <p>The monkey trail runs from behind the reception at the main entrance, around the west side of the zoo to the entrance of the lost forest.</p>
